Silence. 

Absolute silence.
That's the only thing Carl heard after 1 hour in the jungle.
Maybe two. Maybe three. Maybe even more. He didn't know.
He was all alone in the jungle at night, lost. He had lost his compass, bag, watch, and his bag. Nothing

nothing left with him 

He licked his cracked lips, deprived of water
His stomach rumbled and grumbled.
He had been desperately looking for a way out of the dense jungle for a long time.
The dark sky made it harder to look around, and the thorny leaves made it hard to walk.
Carl's legs felt like they were going to give way.
He slowly collapsed to the ground, helpless and simply exhausted.
He let out one last breath he had, muttering, "Help me..."
